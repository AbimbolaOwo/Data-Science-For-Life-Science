# Python basics exercises

1. Create a list containing six numbers and assign it to a variable.

2. Add your least favourite number to the list.

3. Sort your list so that it is in ascending order.

4. Take the fourth item out of the list.

5. Delete the first three items from the list using what you know about del and index slicing.

6. Recreate your initial list and write a for loop which loops over each entry and prints that entry to the console.

7. Write a for loop which will only print if it is the 4th element in your list.
Use f strings to print out statements to the console for the if and else conditionals showing which number was the 4th and were not the 4th element.

8. Write a for loop which uses the range() and len() functions to add 1 to each element in your list.
You will need to use variable updating and indexing in this question.
