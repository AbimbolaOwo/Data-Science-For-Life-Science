# Data-Science-For-Life-Science
The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Genomics Data Science PhD programme currently has 15 participating students, this is expected to grow by approximately 25 students each year for the next three years. As part of the SFI funding, students are encouraged to participate in outreach programs in data science. This particular outreach program is designed for use by wet lab scientists who wish to start learning bioinformatics. 

# Workshop Outline
The workshop will follow this weekly schedule for the duration of the course:
* **Monday**: A markdown file containing materials on the topics covered. These are essentially textbook style markdown documents that have code examples inline. 
* **Monday**: A R markdown / python file worksheet. This is a file you can download and open in R Studio and Spyder respectively. It will contain exercises for participants to complete based on the materials file released on the same day. 
* **Thursday**: Zoom meeting. Course coordinators will participate in a conference call where they will share their screen with participants, and walk through the worksheets provided on Monday.
* **Thursday**: Solutions to the worksheet are provided after the zoom meeting to those who could not attend. 

*Week 1 is an anomaly, dedicated to installing software. The zoom meeting will mostly be an informal meet and greet, if participants have issues or queries they can be addressed in week 1 zoom meeting only*. 

For the duration of the course, participants are encouraged to use the Github "issues" tab to post code queries or issues. This is by far the easiest way for course coordinators to debug issues you may be having. Debugging issues over zoom is not beneficiary for all participants and time consuming. 

## Week 1
##### Installing Dependencies
Working under the assumption that most participants have either a MacOS or a Windows operating system, it is crucial for each user to have access to the same software. For this we have decided to use Anaconda, a package manager deployable across Windows, Mac & Linux systems. The first week of the Workshop will be dedicated to making sure each participant has a fully working version of Anaconda. 

A tutorial on how to install Anaconda is available [here](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/blob/master/Getting%20started/Installing%20Anaconda.md). 

##### Creating a Github account
Github is a free website where users can access code repositories, and create their own repositories to store code, notes and small files of data (max 100MB). As the workshop is being conducted via github, we strongly encourage participants to create a github account. A guide on how to set up a Github account, and how to navigate the website and workshop.

A tutorial on how to set up and navigate Github is available [here](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/blob/master/Getting%20started/GitHub%20Basics.md).

## Week 2 
###### Introduction to R (part 1)
A gentle introduction to R Studio and the R programming language, covering the basic syntax of R. Topics covered include data structures in R, creating + calling variables, logical operators, conditional statements, vectors, functions, for loops, while loops and loading packages in R. 

Resources are available in the following folder [here](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/tree/master/Introduction_to_R/Part_1). 


###### Introduction to Python (part 1)
A gentle introduction to Spyder GUI and the Python programming language, covering the basic syntax of Python. Topics covered include data structures in R, creating + calling variables, logical operators, conditional statements, vectors, functions, for loops, while loops and loading python libraries.
