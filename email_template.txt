#CRT outreach program: Data Science for Life Scientists

Dear X,

The SFI CRT Genomics Data Science is offering a X week workshop aimed at life scientists wanting to upskill in data science.
The course is being assembled by current Genomic Data Science PhD students and is offered to life scientists at the Masters and PhD level. 
Seee below a statement from the course organisers:

"Currently, biomedical research labs are producing vast quantities of "omics" data (metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics)
to address their research questions. By enrolling in this course, participants will be well equipped to embark on a data science
journey by learning the basic statistical concepts and programming skills necessary for analyzing "omic" data. The course will provide 
a comprehensive introduction to both Python and R, as well as mathematical and statistical concepts commonly encountered in
genomic data science. 

The course will be self-paced, with direct access to the creators of the course via Github and weekly Zoom meetings.
