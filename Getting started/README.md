# Workshop Outline
This document contains a breakdown of the topics covered in the workshop. Materials will be generated and diseminated on a week to week basis. Thus, folders for topics in the outline may not be instantly available.

#### Week 1
###### Installing Dependencies
Working under the assumption that most participants have either a MacOS or a Windows operating system, it is crucial for each user to have access to the same software. For this we have decided to use Anaconda, a package manager deployable across Windows, Mac & Linux systems. The first week of the Workshop will be dedicated to making sure each participant has a fully working version of Anaconda. 

###### Creating a Github account
Github is a free website where users can access code repositories, and create their own repositories to store code, notes and small files of data (max 100MB). As the workshop is being conducted via github, we strongly encourage participants to create a github account. 

`Tutorial:` 
* A guide on how to install Anaconda on your operating system. After sucessfully installing Anaconda, participants will be shown how to install Python and R Studio complete with an introduction to their interface. 
* A guide on how to set up a Github account, and how to navigate the website and workshop. 

`Zoom meeting:`
* Assistance will be available to participants via `Zoom` to troubleshoot installation. `Zoom` offers screen sharing mode, allowing tutors to consult error messages you may encounter.
