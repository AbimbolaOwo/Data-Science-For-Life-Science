# Data-Science-For-Life-Science

The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Genomics Data Science PhD programme currently has 15 participating students, this is expected to grow by approximately 25 students each year for the next three years. 

As part of the SFI funding, students are encouraged to participate in outreach programs in data science. This particular outreach program is designed for use by wet lab scientists who wish to start learning bioinformatics. 

The first topic we will cover is how to set up a basic bioinformatics computer environment. This will include getting familiar with online repositiories which are used by bioinformaticians to store their pipelines and code. The one which we will be using is called GitHub (www.GitHub.com). 
Your first task will be to set up an account on the website and follow the CRT GitHub repository, this can be found at www.GitHub.com/Genomics-CRT. 

All of the tutorials and pipelines will be posted on this page in the repositories section and will be available for download here https://github.com/Genomics-CRT?tab=repositories  

GitHub also allows you to raise issues for anything you need help with. This is one of the main reasons we are using GitHub, for the interaction it allows between us. 
To do this, go into the repository that you are having a problem with and click on the issues tab

Once in the issues tab, click on the labels button and select which filter applies to your issue. An example of a label will be “Help wanted”.

Once this is done, click on New issue. This will take you to a page where you can add a title to your issue and describe exactly what is happening, then a member of the CRT will be able to help you through the problem.

That’s the basics of GitHub, feel free to explore the rest of the functions and visit other pages.

The next tutorial will cover installing Anaconda onto your computer.

Any issues regarding the coding excercises are to be posted under `issues`
