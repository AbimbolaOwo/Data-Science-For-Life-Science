# Getting started with Github

Welcome to the Genomics CRT workshop. First things first, you will need to set up a github account! If you are viewing this page and do not have an account, you should see a prompt from Github like this: 

![github_sign_up_1](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_1.png)

Click `sign up` and fill out your account information:

![github_sign_up_2](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_2.png)

Click `Select Plan`, and coose the free plan.

You can skip the next step, or answer the questions to tailor suggestions by Github. Github will not flood your home page like a social media site would, so this step is largely optional. An email will be sent to your email address to confirm the registration.

![github_sign_up_5](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_5.png)

You should now have created a Github account. To find the GenomicsCRT github page, search for the username in the search bar:

![github_sign_up_6](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_6.png)

*Note: be sure to add the dash for Genomics-CRT*

![github_sign_up_7](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_7.png)

Follow the Github page. Any additions made to the `Genomics-CRT` page will show up on your home page.

The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Genomics Data Science PhD programme currently has 15 participating students, this is expected to grow by approximately 25 students each year for the next three years. 

As part of the SFI funding, students are encouraged to participate in outreach programs in data science. This particular outreach program is designed for use by wet lab scientists who wish to start learning bioinformatics. 

The first topic we will cover is how to set up a basic bioinformatics computer environment. This will include getting familiar with online repositiories which are used by bioinformaticians to store their pipelines and code. The one which we will be using is called GitHub (www.GitHub.com). 
Your first task will be to set up an account on the website and follow the CRT GitHub repository, this can be found at www.GitHub.com/Genomics-CRT. 

All of the tutorials and pipelines will be posted on this page in the repositories section and will be available for download here https://github.com/Genomics-CRT?tab=repositories  

GitHub also allows you to raise issues for anything you need help with. This is one of the main reasons we are using GitHub, for the interaction it allows between us. 
To do this, go into the repository that you are having a problem with and click on the issues tab

![Issuestab](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/issuestab.png)


Once in the issues tab, click on the labels button and select which filter applies to your issue. An example of a label will be “Help wanted”.

Once this is done, click on New issue. This will take you to a page where you can add a title to your issue and describe exactly what is happening, then a member of the CRT will be able to help you through the problem.

![issuesform](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202020-04-02%2013-48-53.png)

That’s the basics of GitHub, feel free to explore the rest of the functions and visit other pages.

The next tutorial will cover installing Anaconda onto your computer.

Any issues regarding the coding excercises are to be posted under `issues`
